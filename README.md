# putnam-sms-alert
This script allows the user to pull severe weather alerts from the NWS and send those alerts via email to SMS to any mobile contacts.

It currently works for Sprint,Verizon,Virgin Mobile,Boost Mobile, and AT&T. There is an SMS gateway for T-Mobile listed, but emails originating from an SMTP server are blocked as spam on their network. A workaround is to send the alert to an email address instead.
